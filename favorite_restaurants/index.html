			<p><strong>Bida Manda:</strong> Bida Manda is a thoughtful gathering place celebrating the diverse food traditions and culture of Laos. Bida Manda is the Sanskrit ceremonial term for father and mother. We named the restaurant Bida Manda to honor our parents in Laos, who instilled in us our love of food and its power to bring people together. Our parents' recipes are the inspiration for our menu. Every dish on our menu is exactly what we grew up eating. They are the kind of dishes you might find on the street corners of Luang Prabang and at a Laotian home.

			<p><strong>Beasley's Chicken and Honey:</strong> Chicken, waffles, chicken pot pies and more. This is southern comfort food with a twist. Award winning chef Ashley Christensen, who also runs Poole's, Chuck's and Fox Liquor Bar, has crafted a great casual dining spot with great southern food. In addition to a tempting assortment of house cocktails, libations include half a dozen beers (all draft, all North Carolina brews) and a small but well-chosen wine list. An excellent selection of sparkling wines reflects the owner’s fondness for pairing bubbly with fried chicken.</p>
		</div>

		<div class="container-fluid">
			<p><strong>Garland:</strong> The seasonally driven menu is influenced by the flavors of India and Asia, with locally sourced ingredients reinvented with a distinctly Southern flare. It’s extensive menu of approachable creations features innovative and delicately prepared dishes that are truly unique. Garland continues to wow the culinary scene in Downtown Raleigh, North Carolina offering a casual dining experience in a comfortable yet funky space, with great food, delicious seasonal cocktails and an adventurous wine menu.</p>
